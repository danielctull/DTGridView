h1. DTGridView

A two-dimensional scrolling view component for the iPhone, heavily inspired by UITableView.

*WARNING* DTGridView 1.1 moves the location of all of the classes, so you may need to jiggle things about when updating.

h2. Branch Structure

There are two branches to this repository, *master* and *production*, these are described below. (Thanks to "Abizer":https://github.com/Abizern for showing me this method.)

h3. The master Branch

The master branch contains the class extension files as well as an Xcode project that demonstrates the code and is the branch to use to see how to use the code. It as also the branch that further development of the code should be performed on.

h3. The production Branch

The production branch should be used if you want to add these extensions as a git submodule in other projects and will only contain the class files themselves without the Xcode project or example classes. This is preferable as it will keep your directories clean of any code which is unnecessary to your working project, of course you can switch branches in the submodule to access the given samples.

Changes made to the master branch will be merged across to production, so it will always remain current with respect to master.

To add the production branch rather than master, simply use the -b flag as shown below.

bc. git submodule add -b production git://github.com/danielctull/DTGridView.git

To keep up to date with the latest changes `cd` into the directory that contains this submodule and pull the newest changes as usual

bc. git pull origin

h3. Artefacts

Sometimes, there may be artefacts left over when switching from master to production. These are files that are ignored by git and are easily cleaned up by running

bc. git clean -dxf

h2. Examples

Examples of some of these features can be found in the iPhone app delegate.
